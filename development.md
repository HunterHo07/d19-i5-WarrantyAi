# WarrantyAI - Development Documentation

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with Vite
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom animations
- **Animation Libraries**:
  - GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for complex animations
  - Framer Motion for UI transitions and interactions
  - Three.js for 3D elements and backgrounds
  - Lottie for lightweight animated icons
  - Rive for interactive animations
- **State Management**: React Context API + localStorage for data persistence
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form

### Animation & Visual Effects
- **Background Effects**:
  - Glassmorphism with dynamic blur effects
  - Aurora light animations for accent elements
  - Particle field for interactive backgrounds
  - Liquid mesh animations for transitions
  - Parallax scrolling for depth
- **UI Components**:
  - Custom animated buttons with magnetic hover effects
  - Morphing shapes for section transitions
  - Interactive 3D elements for product visualization
  - Animated progress indicators
  - Micro-interactions on all interactive elements

### Data Management
- **Storage**: localStorage for MVP phase
- **Data Structure**: JSON for warranty records, user preferences, and demo data
- **File Handling**: Browser File API for image uploads
- **Image Processing**: Browser Canvas API for basic image manipulation

- Design system and component library setup

### Phase 2: Core Pages Development (Days 3-5)
- Develop HomePage with interactive hero section
- Create DemoPage with functional warranty scanning simulation
- Build LandingPage with key value propositions
- Implement ShowcasePage with product features

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Animations (Days 6-8)
- Implement 3D background effects and animations
- Create interactive warranty management dashboard
- Develop receipt scanning simulation with AI extraction visualization
- Build warranty tracking timeline with animations

### Phase 4: Additional Pages & Refinement (Days 9-10)
- Develop PitchDeckPage with investor-focused content
- Create WhyUsPage highlighting competitive advantages
- Build RoadmapPage showing future development plans
- Implement responsive design for all pages

### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (Days 11-12)
- Comprehensive testing across devices and browsers
- Performance optimization
- Final polish and refinements
- Deployment to GitHub Pages

## Feature Implementation Details

### Warranty Scanning Simulation
- Upload image through drag-drop or file picker
- Animated scanning effect with progress indicator
- AI extraction visualization showing detected fields
- Confirmation screen with extracted warranty details

### Warranty Dashboard
- Interactive cards for each warranty
- Timeline visualization of warranty periods
- Filtering and sorting capabilities
- Expiration alerts with visual indicators

### Receipt Processing Flow
1. User uploads receipt/invoice/email
2. Animated scanning effect processes the image
3. AI extraction visualization highlights detected information
4. System displays extracted warranty information
5. User confirms or adjusts details
6. Warranty added to dashboard with confirmation animation

## Animation Implementation Guide

### GSAP Animations
- Page transitions with staggered elements
- Scroll-triggered animations for section reveals
- Timeline-based sequences for multi-step animations
- Split text animations for headings

### Three.js Elements
- Abstract 3D background for hero section
- Interactive 3D product models for showcase
- Particle effects for background atmosphere
- Animated mesh gradients for section backgrounds

### Framer Motion
- Micro-interactions for UI elements
- List animations for warranty cards
- Drag-and-drop interactions
- Page transitions and route changes

## Usage Guide

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `bun install`
3. Start development server: `npm run dev` or `bun run dev`
4. Access the application at `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production
1. Run build command: `npm run build` or `bun run build`
2. Preview production build: `npm run preview` or `bun run preview`
3. Deploy the `dist` folder to GitHub Pages

### Project Conventions
- Component naming: PascalCase
- File structure: Feature-based organization
- CSS: TailwindCSS with custom utilities
- State management: Context API for global state, component state for local
- Animation naming: `anim-[effect]-[duration]`

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for heavy components and animations
- Code splitting for optimal bundle size
- Asset optimization for images and 3D models
- Animation performance monitoring
- Conditional rendering of complex animations on lower-end devices

## Future Technical Enhancements
- Integration with actual OCR/AI services
- Backend implementation with user authentication
- Mobile app development with React Native
- API development for business integrations
- Machine learning model for improved warranty detection accuracy
